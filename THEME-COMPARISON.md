## Practical Impact

### Advantages of Dark-Red Theme:
1. **Better for low-light environments** - Much darker backgrounds
2. **Higher contrast** - Brighter text on darker backgrounds
3. **Consistent red accent** - Unified color scheme across desktop
4. **Modern aesthetic** - Clean, minimalist dark design
5. **Eye strain reduction** - Less bright light emission

### When to Use:
- Late night coding/work sessions
- Dark room environments
- When you want a more aggressive/bold aesthetic
- If you prefer higher contrast interfaces

The dark-red theme maintains all the functionality of the original while providing a much more subdued and high-contrast experience.
